# FairShare – College Budget Sharing App
## Members: Maral Bat-Erdene, Aurelia Peterson Rajalingam, Jacqueline Guzman Nunez
Our final project idea is creating a mobile budgeting app designed for college students to easily manage and split shared expenses with friends. Users can create private rooms for different groups, such as “Dorm Room,” “Trip to Vienna,” or “Club Event,” where everyone has a personal profile. Members can post shared costs, attach receipt photos, and choose how to split expenses. There will be options to split equally, by selected items, or custom amounts. Users can tick off payments as they are made, and the app will automatically update the balance to show who has paid and who still owes.
As students post their expenses, the app automatically calculates the total balance for each person, displaying clear plus and minus tags to indicate who should receive or send money. It then provides the final summarized amount each person needs to pay or receive, helping users include this information as the payment description when sending money.
To keep students organized, the app sends payment reminders for upcoming or overdue amounts. It can also convert currencies in real time, which is useful for international students or study-abroad trips. Users can view visual summaries of spending, payments, and outstanding balances through charts and statistics. Additional features include the ability to edit or comment on expenses, add tags or notes for clarity, such as “pizza night” or “utilities,” and manage recurring costs such as rent or shared subscriptions. The app aims to make group budgeting and expense tracking easy, fair, and visually engaging for college life.
Users will have to create an account when they start to use the app. When creating an account, they will be asked for their name, email, phone number, and all of the financial apps they can send and receive money through (for example: Zelle, PayPal, Venmo, CashApp, etc.). When listing all of the financial apps they have accounts with, they will also have to provide information like their username on the financial app, which then other users can use this information to easily send them money through. This will make things easier later on, as when splitting a bill with friends, the user’s friends can click on the user’s profile picture and a small pop up will appear with the financial apps the user accepts and what information the friends need to know so that the friends won’t have to ask the user 50 times for their phone number or username on the financial app. 
Below we have included an image of what we believe the app would look like and behave like. Please let us know if this is too complicated or we dismissed a vital detail. Also, advice on how to gather and retrieve the info needed for this project would be greatly appreciated.
